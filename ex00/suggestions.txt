SUGGESTIONS TO FIX ERRORS - ex00 (btc / BitcoinExchange)
=========================================================
NOTE: These are suggestions only. No code changes have been made.
      This file is separate from errors.txt per the problem requirements.


SUGGESTION 1: Validate input file dates (fixes ERROR 1)
---------------------------------------------------------
In the print_all() method inside BitcoinExchange.cpp, after parsing the
date and amount_token from the input line, call validate_date() on the
date string. If validation throws, catch it and print:
    "Error: bad input => <original line>"

Location: BitcoinExchange.cpp, inside print_all(), within the try block,
after extracting 'date' and before calling parse_amount().

Pseudocode:
    std::string date = trim(line.substr(0, pipe_pos));
    try {
        validate_date(date, 0);   // <-- add this call
    } catch (...) {
        throw BadInputException(""); // rethrow as bad input
    }
    double amount = parse_amount(amount_token, 0);


SUGGESTION 2: Fix error message for wrong argument count (fixes ERROR 2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In main.cpp, when ac != 2, print a message that accurately reflects
the problem: wrong number of arguments.

Current code:
    if (ac != 2)
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: could not open file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

Suggested change:
    if (ac != 2)
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: wrong number of arguments." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }


SUGGESTION 3: Clearer error for date before database range (fixes ERROR 3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, when a valid date predates the earliest entry in the database,
the code throws a generic BadInputException with an empty message, which
results in "Error: bad input => <line>". This matches the subject's
expected output format for this case, so no change is strictly required.

However, if a more descriptive message is desired, in print_all(), after
the check "if (it == _db.begin())", print a message indicating that no
exchange rate is available for dates before the database start.

Note: The subject example also shows "Error: bad input" for such cases,
so this behavior may be intentional.


SUGGESTION 4: Handle future dates explicitly (fixes UNEXPECTED RESULT 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If using the last known rate for future dates is undesired, add a check
after the lower_bound lookup to see if the date is beyond the last
database entry. Currently there is no such check; the code simply finds
the closest lower or equal date by default.

If desired behavior is to use the last known rate (as currently
implemented), document this in a comment for clarity.
