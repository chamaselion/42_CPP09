ERROR REPORT - ex02 (PmergeMe / Merge-Insert Sort)
===================================================
Program: PmergeMe
Compiled with: c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98


ERROR 1: Only one container is used (std::vector only)
-------------------------------------------------------
Description:
  The 42 CPP09 subject requires implementing the Ford-Johnson
  merge-insert sort using AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT container types
  (e.g., std::vector and std::deque), and displaying the processing
  time for each container separately.

  The current implementation uses ONLY std::vector throughout:
    - PmergeMe.hpp only includes <vector>
    - fordJohnsonSort() only takes std::vector<int>
    - run() only creates and sorts a std::vector<int>

  Expected output format per subject:
    Before: 3 5 9 7 4
    After:  3 4 5 7 9
    Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::vector : X us
    Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::deque  : Y us

  Actual output:
    Before: 3 5 9 7 4
    After:  3 4 5 7 9
    Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::vector : 9 us
    (second container line is MISSING)


SORT CORRECTNESS
----------------
Despite the missing second container, the sorting algorithm itself
is correct. The Ford-Johnson algorithm was verified with 50 random
test sequences of sizes 1-30 with values 1-1000, and all produced
results identical to std::sort.

Additional sort correctness tests:
- Already sorted sequence:  PASS (1 2 3 4 5 => 1 2 3 4 5)
- Reverse sorted sequence:  PASS (20 19 ... 1 => 1 2 ... 20)
- Sequence with duplicates: PASS (3 3 1 => 1 3 3)
- Single element:           PASS (42 => 42)
- Two elements:             PASS (2 1 => 1 2)


SUMMARY OF TESTS RUN
--------------------
- No arguments:             PASS (exits 1, "Error: no input sequence provided")
- Negative number (-1):     PASS (exits 1, "Error: invalid character in input")
- Zero (0):                 PASS (exits 1, "Error: only positive integers are allowed")
- Non-numeric (abc):        PASS (exits 1, "Error: invalid character in input")
- Float (1.5):              PASS (exits 1, "Error: invalid character in input")
- Small sequence (5 elems): PASS (sorts correctly)
- Large sequence (20 elems):PASS (sorts correctly)
- INT_MAX value:            PASS (2147483647 accepted, sorts correctly)
- Duplicate values:         PASS (sorts correctly preserving duplicates)
- Already sorted input:     PASS (output matches input)
- Second container output:  FAIL (see ERROR 1 - missing deque implementation)
