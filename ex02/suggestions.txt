SUGGESTION 1: Add a second container (std::deque) implementation (fixes ERROR 1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 42 subject requires demonstrating the Ford-Johnson algorithm on two
different containers and comparing their timing.

Steps to implement:

1. In PmergeMe.hpp:
   - Add #include <deque>
   - Add a static fordJohnsonSortDeque(std::deque<int> &sequence) method

2. In PmergeMe.cpp:
   - Implement a version of fordJohnsonRecurse that operates on
     std::deque<int> instead of std::vector<int> (the logic is the same,
     only the container type changes).
   - Alternatively, refactor fordJohnsonRecurse to be a template function
     that works with any random-access container.

3. In PmergeMe::run():
   - After sorting with vector, create a std::deque<int> from the original
     input and sort it with the deque version.
   - Measure the time for the deque sort separately.
   - Print both time lines:
       std::cout << "Time to process a range of " << sequence.size()
                 << " elements with std::vector : "
                 << vectorMicroseconds << " us" << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Time to process a range of " << dequeSequence.size()
                 << " elements with std::deque  : "
                 << dequeMicroseconds << " us" << std::endl;

Example run() pseudocode:
    std::vector<int> vecSeq = parseArgs(argc, argv);
    std::vector<int> original(vecSeq);
    std::deque<int> deqSeq(vecSeq.begin(), vecSeq.end());

    std::cout << "Before: "; printSequence(original);

    std::clock_t t1 = std::clock();
    fordJohnsonSort(vecSeq);           // sort vector
    std::clock_t t2 = std::clock();
    fordJohnsonSortDeque(deqSeq);      // sort deque
    std::clock_t t3 = std::clock();

    std::cout << "After:  "; printSequence(vecSeq);

    double vecUs = (t2 - t1) * 1e6 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    double deqUs = (t3 - t2) * 1e6 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout << "Time to process a range of " << vecSeq.size()
              << " elements with std::vector : " << vecUs << " us\n";
    std::cout << "Time to process a range of " << deqSeq.size()
              << " elements with std::deque  : " << deqUs << " us\n";
